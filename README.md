# Manual and Automation Testing for Swag Labs 

I am doing a test from this [website](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Manual Testing

I upload the Excel file for the test cases and the bug reports. You can download it [here](https://github.com/ivanasitumorang/SwagLabsTesting/blob/master/TestCase_BugReport.xlsx). 

```bash
Total Test Case: 25
Total Bug Reports: 4
```

## Automation Testing
For automation testing, I use Katalon Studio. I divide the test cases and the bug steps in a different folder but is still in Test Cases Folder.



## Additional
I write the test suite for the complete process from login to logout process, including the checkout process. You can see that in my Github code also.
